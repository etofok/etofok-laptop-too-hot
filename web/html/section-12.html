<h2>CPU - ThrottleStop intro</h2>

<p class="textstream">

ThrottleStop is a free application made by a true legend, one and only /u/uncleWebb.

Go ahead and download, install and launch the app.



ThrottleStop is for Intel processors and is for Windows.

Since I have an Intel processor and am on Windows I will use it.

However, 

in these CPU related sections you will learn pretty much everything you need on this topic.

So regardless of your OS or the app you use you'll be fully equipped to tinker with it.

After all, apps are just interfaces to communicate what you what.

You just need to know what you want.



Go to OPTIONS (down-left corner).

Let's set up 3 profiles:

- [Default]: 'stock' profile as our 'control';

- [Balanced]: average performance mode;

- [High Performance]: The Real Gamer mode.

Names can be whatever.



Set options like this:

Optionally, bind hotkeys to switch between the profiles. 

CTRL + SHIFT + ALT [1] / [2] / [3]



Our two ThrottleStop profiles by pure coincidence perfectly align with Windows power plans:

Balanced and High Performance.

Be mindful whether you have set Processor Performance Maximum at 99% or 100%.



Now assign Windows power plan profiles to your ThrottleStop profiles.

<img class="" src="assets/images/v/ts-profile-2.jpg" alt="">

This allows you to switch between [Balanced] and [High Performance] ThrottleStop Profiles and their respective Power Plans with a hotkey.

This is great because ThrottleStop profiles also control the CPU frequency and voltage.

These are effectively supercharged presets that you can configure on your own in insane detail.

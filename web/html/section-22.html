<h2>RAM - overclocking, random notes</h2>

<p class="textstream">

RAM OC can be extremely beneficial if your have an integrated GPU.

Guess what it is integrated into?

Into the CPU.



So affecting RAM affects the CPU which affects the integrated GPU.

We are talking 50% more sort of boost.

Gaming laptops don't have integrated GPU - by their nature - but it's worth mentioning.



---

Another thing is AMD CPU chips have this special tech built into them, which makes them more sensitive to RAM speeds.

If you have an AMD CPU - probably on desktop - you should take a closer look at overclocking your RAM.

You can get some serious boosts out of it.

Now, there is also <b>UCLK</b> (universal clock)

and also <b>FCLK</b> (fabric clock) for AMD chips.

<b>Just make sure these 3 are synced up.</b>



This is for <b>DDR4</b>.

If you have DDR4-3200, 

your MCLK = UCLK = FCLK <i>should be exactly 1600 Mhz</i>.



DDR5 is much faster (i.e. DDR5-<b>6000</b>) - FCLK won't be able to keep up. 

So you can't realistically sync FCLK to MCLK/UCLK on DDR5.



But since I have <b>not</b> personally overclocked a DDR5 stick 

(I'm not poor, the proper term is "financially challenged") 

I can't really write about it in detail.

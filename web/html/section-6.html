<h2>The Silicon Lottery</h2>

<p class="textstream">

All components come out of the factory slightly different.

Sometimes noticeably different.

Like up to 20-30% different.

This is often referred to as the 'silicon lottery'.



My particular CPU can be 'better' than yours.

Or not.

'Better' in a sense of potential top speeds <b>and/or</b> voltage numbers required.

If you're lucky you can increase the frequency quite a lot.

Or seriously lower the voltage.

Or both.

Or not.

Who knows.



But to account for this randomness, manufacturers pre-set voltages <b>high enough</b> so even the worst components are stable out of the gate.

All components should work with 100% stability on a factory new laptop.

The fact that most components <b>can</b> run much cooler is a lesser concern, than the fact that a customer may receive a factory-new laptop that isn't stable. 

Just imagine that.



Thankfully for us that means two wonderful things:

1. <b>Almost all components are pre-set to run hotter than they <u>should</u></b>.

2. <b>Almost all components are pre-set to run at a lower speed than they <u>could</u></b>.



That's why things like <b>overclocking</b> and <b>undervolting</b> are possible to begin with.

We will discuss both.

Starting with speed.

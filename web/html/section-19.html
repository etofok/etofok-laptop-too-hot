<h2>GPU - memory</h2>

<p class="textstream">

Unlike CPU <b>core</b> and cache</b>, 

GPU has <b>core</b> and <b>memory</b>.



GPU core does the math.

Raytracing, physics, delivering the image to your screen.



GPU memory holds data in its VRAM.

It doesn't manipulate your textures/files on your hard disk.

So anything that requires unloading/loading stuff from/to VRAM - is a GPU memory task.



So far we played with GPU core.

But <b>GPU memory</b> can be adjusted directly in the main menu.

It's super easy - the slider is right there.

If you want more performance our of it - you can bump GPU memory.

The maximum you can push GPU memory is actually quite insane.

Depending on your card model (and your lottery luck) it can range from +200 MHz - +1000 MHz

And unlike GPU core - it doesn't really increase your temps much.

You can experiment with it.



Now on <b>Underclocking the memory</b>.

Underclocking the memory makes sense if you experience stability issues.

Like artifacts on your screen:

Triangles flying. 

Weird tearing. 

Stripes out of nowhere.

Random squares covering the screen.

The usual.



Underclocking GPU memory is a great way to save that GPU from going directly into the trash bin.

So if a GPU starts acting out - try underclocking it first.

It almost always a solution.



I guess that covers the GPU.

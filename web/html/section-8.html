You can't manage what you don't measure.

You want to get a 'feel' for your machine.

You want to feel its pulse.

Go ahead and install a monitoring tool. 

There are a plenty of, but you're going to need MSI Afterburner.

For our purposes we only need to see 4 things.

CPU usage, CPU temperature
GPU usage, GPU temperature.

(if voltage control is grayed out, ignore it for now)

<h2>Some heat math</h2>

<p class="textstream">

If you only demand 2.4 GHz performance out of your CPU, then the voltage <i>needed</i> to sustain <i>this level of demand</i> is much lower than if you were to demand 4.1 GHz from the same CPU.

The higher the demand - the higher voltage <i>should</i> be. 

The lower the demand, the lower the voltage <i>can</i> be.



Now.

Higher frequency (MHz) makes it run hotter.

Because there's more work being done.

And higher voltage (v) - which is required to run at higher performance - makes it <i>even</i> hotter.

These two <b>stack on top each other like multipliers</b>.



Frequency is simple.

A CPU that runs at 4.0 GHz produces twice as much heat as if were running at 2.0 GHz.

Because it's twice faster.

100% increase in frequency = 100% increase in heat.

It's a direct, linear increase.

Very simple.



Now, not only 4.0 GHz <i><b>requires</b></i> more voltage than 2.0 GHz

the amount of heat from that voltage <b>is not scaled linearly</b>.

But <i><b>quadratically</b></i>.

(yep, you need 5th grade math to read the next 5 lines)



-> A real world scenario: 

You bump voltage from 1.1v to 1.2v,

1.1² = 1.21

1.2² = 1.44

1.44/1.21 = 19% more

You bumped voltage by <b>9%</b> and got <b>19%</b> more heat.

And for what? 

To run at <b><i>hotter</i></b> frequencies to begin with?

Ooph.

The synergy between Frequency (MHz) and Voltage (V) ramps up fast.

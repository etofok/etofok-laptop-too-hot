<h2>5 Reasons Why Your Laptop Degrades</h2>

<p class="textstream">

By default all gaming laptops are frying pans.

Cookware.

You can cook, but it also needs to get very hot.



But at the same time,

few things are worse for the longevity of your laptop than <b>heat</b>.

That's why right off the bat you need to understand one thing:

Anything that makes your laptop hotter than it <b>should be</b> - is bad. 



Here are the 5 main laptop killers.



<b>Stress</b>

When we make our components work we put them under stress.

When we make our components work <b>very hard</b> we put them under <b>a lot more</b> stress.

We want to reduce that stress.



<b>Electricity</b>

You need electricity flowing through your components.

And components need a certain amount of it to sustain a certain level of performance output.

Otherwise they can't sustain the demand and problems occur.

We want to reduce that amount of electricity flow.



<b>Dust</b>

You might think this is something trivial, but it's not. 

Dust is - no joke - the main laptop killer.

Yep. 

Just dust.

The stuff you probably should clean up more often. 

The cooling system of a laptop is just barely enough to cool its components under stress.

And that's a cooling system <b>of a factory new</b> laptop!

We want less dust. 



<b>Cooling system</b>

It degrades.

The coolant medium inside the tubes of a cooling system breaks down over time.

Fans loose their lubrication - start to grind and rattle.

Thermal paste dries up.

The system gets increasingly less efficient at doing its job.

It 'ages'. 

Just like you.

Can't stop it.

But you can maintain things to give them more health.



<b>Lack of tech literacy</b>

Over time, users tend to install a lot of garbage.

Garbage makes their system work harder, for zero gain.

Goes without saying you want less garbage.



Now imagine running a dusty, overclocked, dried up gaming laptop for 10 hours a day for years?

...

The pain.



Some of you do it though.

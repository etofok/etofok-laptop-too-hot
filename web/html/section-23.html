<h2>RAM - overclocking, timings intro</h2>

<p class="textstream">

RAM timings is an enigma.

But these are as important as the frequency.



What is a timing?

A timing is a delay.

If I order a pizza it comes at a delay.

The lower the delay - the faster is comes.

Lower = better.

This is another <i>dimension</i> for hunting down performance, but it's different from clock speed.



Timing is measured in <i>cycles</i>, not seconds.

<i>Timing is how many cycles the job is going to take.</i>

If you have a faster RAM the cycles run faster.

So a task that takes 20 cycles at 1000 MHz is going to take twice as long than at 2000 MHz.

Because 2000 MHz is twice faster than 1000 Mhz.

MCLK (or DDR, since they are 'linked') defines how fast your cycles run.



These two setups are identical in real-time nanoseconds:

timing-16 cycles at 3200 MT/s 

timing-20 cycles at 4000 MT/s

If you take a second look at these numbers you will notice the same 2:1 relationship between the timings and transfer rates.

There more cycles (16 → 20), but cycles run faster (3200 → 4000 MT/s).



So which of the two is better?

You deciding between <b>latency</b> - <i>fewer</i> cycles, "tigher" timings

and <b>bandwidth</b> - more data can be transfered at a faster speed and thus at <i>faster</i> cycles.



Usually, the second scenario is better, because with more bandwidth the CPU gets all the data it needs, when it needs.

You went from a 32 lanes highway road to 40.

The speed limit is the same, but now more cars can move freely at the same time.

Every car can deliver you a pizza, so you have more pizzas per second.

This affects 'clogged' situations like a heavy teamfight in a game where CPU gets overwhelmed with data.

With more bandwidth it's going to drop less frames, because there are more frames being delivered instead of sitting is a traffic jam.

This affects 1% lows fps, fps drops, max fps, heavy data manipulation like zip/upzip or video editing.



The only scenario in which you <i>wouldn't</i> want more bandwidth is when <i>you don't need more bandwidth</i>.

40 lanes is more than enough for 20 cars - you would rather have faster cars.

If you maxed out your FPS and you never drop a single frame - having more bandwidth does nothing.

But this is somewhat unrealistic.

FPS always drop and you always want more FPS.



It's important to understand that increasing your data transfer rate, in a way, makes your timings faster without actually making them tighter.

Because faster speed = faster cycles.



You switch your attention to timings when you just can't get more data rate out of your RAM anymore.

After all, there's a limit.

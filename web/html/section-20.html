<h2>RAM - overclocking, preparation</h2>

<p class="textstream">

Overclocking RAM to its absolute potential is a full blown hobby.

A black hole to waste you time into.

No reasonable person should ever bother.



But all progress depends on being unreasonable.

There is a lot that goes into this process.

It's much more complicated and technical.



Think of RAM as server for your CPU.

In CPU intensive tasks, you can get a noticeable performance boost from RAM OC.

And that's <i>on top</i> of CPU overclocking.

You can also brick your files and/or operating system - which is files - permanently.



Before you start fiddling with RAM you should prepare a couple of things.



<b>First</b>, 

<b>find out how to reset BIOS</b>/Clear CMOS. 

On most laptops you can hold the power button for 60 seconds to reset it.

But not always.

Either way, you <i>need</i> to figure out how to reset BIOS.

Every step a little-too-aggressive bricks your boot process. 

Because things have to load into RAM to boot.

And if RAM fails, things can't load into RAM - so you can't boot.

You won't even get to see your BIOS.

Be aware that when you reset BIOS - you reset <i>all</i> the BIOS changes you made, such as disk priority or voltage unlocks.



<b>Second</b>, 

check <b>Safe Boot</b> in BIOS.

This is a BIOS setting that automatically resets BIOS after multiple failed boots.

Helpful. 

But not guaranteed to work, that's why I put it second.



<b>Third</b>,

CPU / GPU stress testing provides immediate feedback.

RAM? Not always.

If you went way too aggressive - you just won't boot.

But if you went mildly too aggressive - you <i>will</i> boot.

And RAM is going to corrupt all your files as it processes them in the background.



So please. 

<b>You have to test</b> with Memtest / OCCT / TM5 at every step up.

At least for 30 minutes.

These are <i>not your final tests</i>, but you can get a feel whether RAM is throwing errors right off the bat.



This is <i>omega</i> important.

Much more important that catching a BSOD or reboots and here's why.



Think about how RAM works - it loads stuff from your hard drive for your CPU to use.

When RAM completes processing that data - it unloads it back to the hard drive.

A faulty or 'starved' RAM <i>makes errors while managing that data</i>.

The data now has errors - <b>it has become corrupted</b>.

<i>Then RAM unloads that corrupted data onto your hard drive, overwriting the files.</i>



It doesn't know the data is corrupted.

It just loads and unloads it.

It got the original file, fucked it up, and returned it.

And now you have a permanently damaged file on your hard drive.



This is pretty bad as is - because you might not be able to open or use that file anymore.

Now imagine that was a <i>system file</i>.

It's game over.

And guess where you operating system is - always - by default?

That's right - in RAM.



So even if you successfully booted into operating system, 

it's <i>not at all</i> means the RAM is not producing errors <i>right now</i>.

That's why you absolutely have to check RAM health at every step.



Your 'final' RAM test <b>should be hours</b> long.

We are talking 100 cycles long.

That's going to confirm and finalize it.

<h2>RAM - overclocking, easy, but strong plays</h2>

<p class="textstream">

Thankfully, there are a couple plays anyone can do.



<b>First</b>,

Make sure you have 2 (two) identical memory sticks installed.

This gives you <b>Dual-channel</b>.

2 sticks perform <i>cosmically</i> better than 1 stick.

Dual-channel <i>doubles your RAM bandwidth</i>:

You had a 2 lane road, now you have a 4 lane road.

This alone gives you <i>massive, massive</i> performance gains,

much more <i>than anything else you might ever do for with your RAM</i>.

Depending on your configuration and task,

we are talking up to <i>50% more performance</i>.

This is by far the best thing you can do.



<b>Second</b>, 

I would recommend checking whether your specific model has <b>XMP Profile</b>.

<b>XMP Profile</b> is essentially Turbo for RAM.

It's a preset that's going to get you <i>at least 50% of your max possible RAM overclock</i>.

At which point you should probably chill.

I want to reiterate chasing that other half is a whole blown activity, and very autistic at that.



<b>Third</b>, 

Just like you can bump/lower CPU ratio multiplier, 

you can as easily bump/lower RAM ratio multiplier.



<b>Real world example</b>:

I noticed that my laptop supports DDR-2933, while my Task Manager shows 2666.

This is actually a very common thing for laptops.



Decided to give it a lift.

1. Reboot, tap Delete to Enter BIOS

2. Go to <i>Overclocking Performance Menu</i> 

3. Go to <i>Memory</i>

4. Increase the <i>Ratio</i>

I changed Ratio from 10 to 11, which bumped my RAM speed (DDR transfer rate) from 2666 to 2933.

This is nice because this was simple and free.



Without going into technical detail here 

(and they get very technical I promise)

This was actually a big overclock, at 0.1% the effort.

I didn't touch voltage.

I didn't touch "timings" (oh God).

I directly got ~10% RAM bandwidth AND at ~9% decrease in system latency.

Realistically,

this gives me up to <i>~10% more average FPS / CPU performance</i> in non-GPU bound scenarios, <i>~9% less fps drops</i>, <b><i>and also</i></b> a <i>~9% decrease in system latency / responsiveness of everything</i>.

This is not nothing at all.



So what did we just do?

RAM - just like the CPU - has a <i>core speed</i> and a <i>ratio multiplier</i>.

Universally, RAM core speed is 133.33 MHz. 

(CPU was 100 MHz if you remember)

But by bumping the multiplier from 10 to 11, my RAM frequency should've gone up...

...from 1333 to 1466?

What?



Well, it did.

That (1333/1466) frequency is actually <b>Memory Clock - MCLK</b>.

That is, in fact, the real RAM operating frequency.



Now follow the hand - <b>DDR</b> (as in DDR3, DDR4, DDR5) stands for......

<b><u>D</u>ouble <u>D</u>ata <u>R</u>ate</b>



So if we multiply <i>MCLK</i> by <i>Double</i> we get...

(133.33 * 10) * 2 = DDR-2666

(133.33 * 11) * 2 = DDR-2933

(133.33 * 12) * 2 = DDR-3200

Cool?



Saying DDR-3200 MHz is <i>also incorrect</i>.

Your task manager is wrong.

Your BIOS is also wrong.

Because they say DDR-3200 <i>MHz</i>.

That is a lie for the sake of simplicity. 

Or marketing.



DDR-3200 is <b>d</b>ata <b>r</b>ate <i>transfer speed</i>.

The correct notation for DDR is <b>MT/s</b> - <b>mega transfers per second</b>.

DDR-3200 <i>is not</i> 3200 MHz.

DDR-3200 <i>is</i> 3200 MT/s.

DDR-3200 <i>operates</i> at 1600 <b>MHz</b>.

MCLK MHz = clock speed * multiplier

DDR MT/s = clock speed * multiplier * 2

So MCLK is always half DDR.

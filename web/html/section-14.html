<h2>Undervolting - intro</h2>

<p class="textstream">

Now you've learned a plenty about managing CPU frequency.

But that's just one side of this coin.



In fact, we can lower our temperatures <i>without sacrificing performance</i>.

By lowering the voltage.

At least to a point.

And to find that point - is to successfully <i>undervolt</i>.



Think of a spectrum from 'too little voltage' to 'too much voltage'.

It's the <i>same</i> spectrum as going from 'unstable and can't work' to 'fried and destoyed'.

It's always a balance between stability, temperature and performance.

And as mentioned earlier, a laptop in its factory configuration is <i>always</i> too hot.

It <i>has to be</i> a little too hot.

And with time, use and wear - it's only getting hotter.

And that's a problem.



We are going to tinker with voltage(-s).

And we need to find that delicate spot of 'barely, but <b>exactly enough</b>'.

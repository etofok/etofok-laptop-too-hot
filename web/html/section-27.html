<h2>Battery - 60% / 80% / 100% Cap</h2>

<p class="textstream">

MSI users can prolong lifespan of the battery by capping it at 60%/80%.

Battery won't charge beyond that point, effectively reducing its maximum capacity.

Maybe your laptop has something along these lines as well.



But why would you reduce its maximum capacity?

This is actually <i>what you want to do</i> if you think how batteries work.



Long story short, 

Imagine filling a rubber balloon with air - stretching it to its absolute limits

And then letting the air out.

Then you do it 500 times.

The rubber balloon won't even look the same.

This is exactly what happens when you push the battery to 100%.



And worse - if you keep it there. 

Because to keep it there you have to charge it even when it drops to 99%.

So you keep it maximally stretched and stressed and also under charge.

Needless to say, that affects the battery.



So, the best thing you can do - is to limit the battery charge to 80%, or even 60%.

That's going to <b>increase lifespan of your battery x2 - x3</b>.



And realistically, there is no reason no to do it.

If occasionally you do need the 100% charge, 

you can easily revert the cap and just charge it before you go.



I use this app called RWEverything. 

It's 3 megabytes portable.



Open <i>Embedded Controller</i>, the blue looking laptop icon.

You'll see a table of XY addresses; X - row, Y - column. 

For gen 9 and gen 10 CPUs - find the <b>EF</b> address, 

for gen 11 CPUs - find the <b>D7</b> address.

Here's the <b>EF</b> address of my gen-10 Intel i5-<u><b>10</b></u>200H.



Double click this cell and set the value in this address to BC for the 60% charge cap.

BC - 60% battery charge cap 

D0 - 80% battery charge cap

E4 - 100% battery charge cap

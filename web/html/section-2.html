<h2>RIP to all the gaming laptops</h2>

<p class="textstream">

That's why gaming laptops degrade <b>so much faster</b>.

Much higher stress on components - games are heavy.

A lot more electricity running through these components to support that level of demand (which is high).

And on top of that - gamers play for hours on end. 



Just one year of heavy use like that is enough to see a noticeable degradation.

And it ramps up <b>fast</b>.

Here's how it works.



Over time, your laptop gathers dust.

Dust gets stuck inside because there's nowhere to go. 

Imagine you were a dust speckle and you ended up inside a laptop. 

How do you get out?

You don't.

So eventually dust starts clogging up everything reducing airflow and making everything hotter.

This makes the fans work harder.



As dust accumulates, it covers all the insides like a blanket.

A lot of dust can even clog the heat sinks and vents!

It gets hard to blow the hot air out.

So <b>more</b> of the hot air gets stuck inside.

That's more work for the fans, so try harder, become louder.



Thermal paste dries up with time.

Fans need to work even harder.



Gradually, but surely the laptop gets hotter and hotter...



This is a feedback loop.

A literal death spiral.

There is only so much your tiny fans can do.



You <b>need to maintain your hardware</b> if you want it to last years.

Sitting in front of a computer all day long, turns out, doesn't give you tech skills.

Only 'sitting in front of a computer' skills

(and even that is not guaranteed).



I know senior level programmers who haven't ever dissembled their laptops once.

0 maintenance skills.

"Yeah it's a little laggy, but what can you do."



I don't judge,

this is just to highlight that it's a different set of skills.

No one is born with it.

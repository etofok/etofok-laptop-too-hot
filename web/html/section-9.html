<h2>CPU - The 99% Lock</h2>

<p class="textstream">

Before we start fiddling with voltage, let's get a sense for clock speed.

And how it directly affects heat.


1. Go to "<i>Power Options</i>"

(the battery icon in your tray area or WIN+R > powercfg.cpl)

2. Go to "<i>Advanced Settings</i>"

3. Scroll down to find "Processor Power Management Maximum".

4. Reduce it from 100% to <b>99%</b>.

If your CPU comes with some sort of <i>Turbo Boost</i>

This disables it.



Look at this:

??????????

That is a ridiculous drop!

We are talking about 20-30 degrees LESS.

I like it because it's extremely unintuitive - the adjustment was just 1%!



So what happened?

'Turbo' is simply a pre-baked into the chip overclocking profile.

<i>(Kind of like XMP for RAM)</i>



The manufacturer figured out what the chip is capable of and created an OC (overclocking) <i>preset</i>.

My MSI GF65 comes with 2.4 GHz 'base' CPU frequency and 4.1 GHz 'Turbo Boost' CPU frequency.

This is not the absolute maximum, but it'll work on all laptops of this model.

So it's advertisable.

People want performance, they buy it, and the world lives another day.



Again, Turbo is an in-built overclocking <i>preset</i>.

It comes pre-configured with frequency and <i><b>voltage</b></i>.

So you effectively over-under<b>clock</b> it <b><i>AND</i></b> over-under<b>volt</b> in one move.

And unsurprisingly, you see a massive temperature difference.



Now, this is not free.

My specific laptop goes from 4.1 GHz to 2.4 GHz.

This is a big drop in CPU performace: -42% to be exact.

However, unless you're doing something exclusively CPU bound, the real-world performance drop is less than that number.



For example, in video games you also have GPU and RAM doing stuff.

CPU is not alone there.

In this example, you'd get maybe 30% less FPS - but not 42% less.

But why would you ever do it?

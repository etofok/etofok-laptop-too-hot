<h2>Voltage</h2>

<p class="textstream">

Turn on the faucet in your kitchen: 

the force that's pushing out the water is pressure.

And by adjusting the mixing tap you can adjust that pressure to your needs to push out more - or less - water <i>per second</i>.

<b>Voltage</b> is like that, just with pushing electricity.



Your components <i>need</i> a certain amount of electricity to do their job.

More work per second - more voltage per second.

You don't want to 'starve' your components. 

They won't work. 

Imagine trying to run a car engine on a drop of gas - it's just not enough to run it.

And the bigger the engine - and its power output - the more gas it needs to work.



The faster the CPU (and its output) - the more voltage it needs to work.

The faster the GPU (and its output) - the more voltage it needs to work.

The faster the RAM (and its output) - the more voltage it needs to work.



<i>Too little</i> voltage to run the demand - bad things happen. 

The best - BSOD or some sort of reboot. 

That's usually a starved CPU.



The worst - you permanently corrupt your files - they will never open. 

Or even worse - you corrupt a <i>system</i> file and can't boot anymore. 

Literally have to reinstall the whole system.

This is usually a starved RAM problem.

(Don't starve your RAM kids)



<i>Too much</i> voltage to run the demand - bad things happen.

A little too much - just makes your stuff hotter.

And degrade faster.

A not-little too much - just going to fry it. RIP.



<b>It's always a balance between stability, temperature and performance.</b>

Pick 2.



Here is how it works.

<h2>Final Result - cyberpunk 2077 test</h2>

<p class="textstream">

Synthetic stress tests tend to stress either the CPU or the GPU, but not both.

A heavy video game stresses everything: CPU, GPU, RAM, drives - everything at once.

And this heat compounds on itself.

Stacks.



Heat from CPU affects GPU and RAM, and they heat up more.

Heat from GPU affects CPU and RAM, and they heat up more.


Plus, we haven't done all this work just to look at synthetic tests.

We want real-world tests.



-------------------



MSI GF65, i5-10200H, NVIDIA RTX 3060, Dual-channel RAM DDR4-2666.


CPU core -185mv @ 4.1 GHz;

CPU cache -85mv @ 4.1 GHz;

GPU -88mv @ 1755 MHz;

RAM Overclocked to 2933 MT/s, no voltage or timings changes;

Fresh thermal paste Cooler Master Mastergel Pro V2;

Cyberpunk 2077 (2022 version) - full ultras, DSLR ON, Ray Tracing OFF, FPS uncapped;



<b>Result:</b>

<b>From the absolute limit of CPU at 95°C and GPU at 86°C my particular laptop dropped down to 77°C and 71°C respectively.</b>



I value longevity, so I'm going to drop my in-game settings down from ultras.

I honestly don't care about graphics, I play older games with no problems.

I want better FPS at manageable temps. 

Your preferences may vary. 



Either way, now it's possible to play at sustainable temps with settings maxed out,

The result is very pleasing.

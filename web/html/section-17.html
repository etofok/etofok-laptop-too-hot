<h2>GPU - Undervolting the GPU</h2>

<p class="textstream">

We already made some <b>massive</b> progress.

Congratulations.

In this chapter we will tinker with the GPU.

Given what we have learned already - it's smooth sailing ahead.



The GPU frequency is just that - frequency.

There are no cores.

Or multipliers.

If your GPU says it's 1500 MHz - it's 1500 MHz.

So instead of adjusting 'core multipliers', we're going to adjust the frequency itself.



Let's get our baselines first.



Download, install and open <b>GPU-Z</b> for monitoring.

Download, install and open <b>Unigine Valley</b> or <b>Furmark</b> for stress testing.

Run a stress test and figure out your <b><i>maximum</i> 'GPU Clock'</b> and <b><i>maximum</i> 'GPU Voltage'</b>.

For me that's 1755 MHz and 0.9v, respectively.

Remember or note these numbers down.



Also pay attention to your GPU benchmark score.

That's the real performance of your card.

Might be useful if you want to overclock it and see how much better it performs.




Now go back to MSI Afterburner.

(!) Do not check the "<i>Apply overclocking at system startup</i>" <b>unless and until</b> you're 100% confident your GPU undervolt offset is stable enough to boot.

Otherwise you won't be able to boot to change it.

Set auto applying <i>only after you ok your results</i>.



Now,

1. Open MSI Afterburner - Open Settings

2. Go to 'General' Tab

3. Check 'Unlock Voltage Control'.

4. Press Apply/OK

5. In the main Afterburner screen press CTRL+F.



This opens the 'Voltage/Frequency curve editor'

This is where the magic happens.

Notice the legend: 

1. left-to-right is <b>voltage</b>.

2. bottom-to-top is <b>frequency</b>.



This is what to expect: 

Unlike undervolting the CPU, 'on fail' you won't get a BSOD.

The stress testing application will either freeze or black screen.

Either way, you'll immediately notice that something has happened. 

Try to kill the app via ALT+F4 or Task Manager, and if that fails just shutdown.



Anyway, let's do this.

Find the node of your max GPU voltage.

(For me that is 0.9v, as seen in GPU-Z.)

It also horizontally lies on the 1755 MHz row.



Grab a node to the left of it.

I start at around -50mv.

So I drag the 850mv node up to the 1755 MHz frequency row.

You only need to drag ONE node.



Steps to follow:

1. Left-click a few pixels to the left of the node you just touched.

2. Hold Shift - Hold Left Click and 'drag' left-click to the right. 
   This way you select every node to the right with a blue box.

3. Press Shift + L. 
   This will flatten the curve.

4. Press Enter, twice.

5. Now you are back in the main menu.
   (optionally enter the Curve Editor again (CTRL+F) again to verify it has been adjusted.

6. Click Apply.

7. Save Profile to 1.

8. Done.


After some stepping down (and tests!) I figured that I need at least 812mv to function at that frequency.

This is a decrease of 88mv from the default 900mv / 0.9v.

Nice.

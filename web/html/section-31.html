<h2>Thermal paste - replacement walkthrough</h2>

<p class="textstream">

This is a super valuable skill. 

Once you learn this power - you'll be able to do it for other people, 

which means you can make decent money as a side hustle or even a job.



And this service is not cheap: 

call your local repair shop and ask how much they charge for this - you'll be surprised. 



Remember me when you buy your first lambo.



- Prepare your workplace, keep in mind all the tips above.

- Respect your workstation and laptop, don't be an animal.

- Make absolutely sure the laptop is 100% off, not in sleep, not in hibernate.

- Carefully place your laptop upside down on the cleaned up table.



- Unscrew all the screws off the back plate.

- Put the screws in some small box so you don't lose them.

- Put the box at a distance so you don't spill it.

- Grab a tool to open the case. Start from either side. I usually start where the headphone jack is. Crack the sides, then the front, then the back.

- Somehow, gradually but surely it'll pop off.

- Don't put things on wool or carpets.



- Locate the battery - the big black box. You can't miss it - it's huge.

- Disconnect the battery. There's exactly one cable that connects it to the motherboard. The cable has red-black mini-cables. The connector is big, you can't miss it. 

If you skip this step there's a good chance (not 100%, but very high) you'll short circuit something. 

If the laptop is in sleep (not in shutdown) the chance is 100%.

- <i>After</i> you have disconnected the battery cable - <i>press the power button a couple of times</i>. To be dead sure, you can hold it for 10 seconds. This clears whatever the electric charge might still be present in the laptop.



- Clean out the dust: canned air is ideal.

- Do not vacuum clean it.

- Take a photo in case you forget how to put it back together.

- Undo the cables connecting the cooling system to the board.

- Unscrew the cooling system, and slowly remove it off the board. Use both hands.



- If thermal paste is dry it'll feel like the cooling system is glued to the components. I promise it's never glued. Wiggle it.

- Use cotton pads to remove the old thermal paste.

- Don't use water. You don't need to use any liquids.

- Apply your fresh thermal paste to the CPU <i>and GPU</i> in a 50% length 'X' shape in the middle.

- Do not spill TP on the motherboard. Don't leave it there if you did. Use cotton sticks / q-tips to remove it if needed.



- Place the cooling system back. Be wary of the cables.

- Screw the cooling system back in, reconnect the cables, refer to your photo if needed.

- Connect the battery dead last.



- Put the back plate on, but don't screw it yet.

- Turn the laptop on - verify it boots.

- All should be great unless you forgot to connect something.

- Then you can screw the back plate.

Done.

Next time is going to be much faster.

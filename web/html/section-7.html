<h2>Overclocking and Underclocking</h2>

<p class="textstream">

To increase performance output of a component is to <b>overclock</b> it.

For example, bumping up a component's operating frequency from 3.0 GHz to 3.5 GHz.


Overclocking is a very common play for desktops.

Why desktops?

Because unlike laptops, these beasts can be fitted with some serious cooling - from massive fans to water.

And that helps with heat.



Desktops are also less crammed in terms of physical space. 

They are simply bigger and more spacious than laptops.

Components are reasonably spaced apart from each other.

All this allows for more airflow in-between components, which help with the cooling.



There's also another one - if you manage burn your desktop CPU/GPU - you can replace it.

It's expensive, but laptop CPU/GPU are <i>literally soldered</i> to the motherboard.

So it's not as plug-n-play.



To decrease performance output of a component is to <b>underclock</b> it.

For example, nudging a component's operating frequency down from 3.5 GHz to 3.0 GHz.

People also use "downclocking", but I don't.



But why would anyone want to decrease performance?

Well, mainly - to drop the temperatures.

<i><b>And massively.</b></i>

I already want to show you an example.

But if you want to see it on your machine, you want to set up some basic monitoring.

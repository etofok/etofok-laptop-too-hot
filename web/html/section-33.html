<h2>Final Result - CPU stress test</h2>

<p class="textstream">

Here's the ThrottleStop CPU stress test:



What we started with: 

93°C - 95°C at 4.1 GHz



After undervolting: 

From 93°C - 95°C to 85°C - 87°C, 

a 8°C - 10°C degrees drop under stress. 



This is a very respectful drop in temperatures without any drop in performance.

In fact, a potential increase in performance because we no longer hit PROCHOT CPU throttling.

Also an increase in CPU longevity and personal comfort due to decreased heat.



After undervolting and thermal paste replacement:

From 85°C - 87°C to 76°C - 78°C, 

dropped yet another ~8°C degrees.



This is with fans at 100% @ 4.1 GHz.

In this test I have not pushed my RAM beyond just going from 10 to 11 multiplier.



Bonus tip: 

Sometimes if I feel like my TP needs replacement (year+) I just underclock my CPU instead, because it's a lazy fix that takes 5 seconds to do instead of committing to the whole replacement process which requires me to stand up from my gaming chair.

<h2>Thermal paste - intro</h2>

<p class="textstream">

Thermal paste (TP) - also known as thermal compound - dries up.

With use.

With time.

Entropy is a bitch.

No joke,

There might be <i>30°C degrees of difference</i>

between a freshly applied thermal paste and a dry one.

Depending on how barren it is.



No thermal paste = no heat transfer.

You want thermal paste, because you don't want <b>air between the chip and the cooling system</b>.

Thermal paste ensures there's no air, so heat gets transferred.


Kind of like you can sit in a 90°C sauna but can't in 90°C water - 

water is a better conductor than air.

So having no conductivity (TP) is <i>as bad as not having the cooling system at all</i>.

You don't want your fans to scream for no meaningful impact. 



And if you choose to ignore this just keep in mind that it doesn't get better.

With enough time you'll be idling at 50°C+ degrees, and running heavy apps is going to be borderline impossible.

Despite your fans running at 100% you'll be at PROCHOT temps all the time.

This kills the laptop.



The good thing I found my MSI laptop to very easy to work with. 

With proper tools and experience it's possible to disassemble, replace thermal paste and assemble back in under 15 minutes.

Your first time is always going to be awkward.

As is with many things in life.

But this is seriously not complicated, especially if you have access to YouTube.

I promise people have disassembled your exact laptop on camera.



I'm going to show you how I do it, step by step. 

But before that, I need to preface this process with a few words of caution.

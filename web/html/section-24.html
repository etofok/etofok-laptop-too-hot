<h2>RAM - overclocking, timings in detail</h2>

<p class="textstream">

Here below I'm going to outline the most common timings and how I understand them.



When you see <i>timings</i> as a thing, you usually see something like this:

16-18-18-38

17-19-19-38

18-20-20-52

or something similar to this pattern.



These are the <i>4 primary timings</i>:

<b>tCL-tRCD-tRP-tRAS</b>

<b>t</b> stands for timing.



I will start with the second primary timing to paint an analogy.



<b>tRCD [2]</b>

tCL-<b>tRCD</b>-tRP-tRAS

tRCD [2] - <b>t</b>iming <b>R</b>ow Address to <b>C</b>olumn Address <b>D</b>elay

You don't need to remember the acronyms - I looked them up myself.

(it gets technical, but this is what advanced looks like).


You memory operates massive tables.

Tables have rows and columns.

X, Y coordinates give you the exact data address.

Kind of like when the pizza guy is already at a customer street, but now needs to get to the exact house.

That time to find the house is <b>tRDC</b>.



<b>tCL [1]</b>

<b>tCL</b>-tRCD-tRP-tRAS

tCL [1] - <b>t</b>iming <b>C</b>AS (Column Address Strobe) <b>L</b>atency

This is the first primary timing.

Once the pizza guy arrives at your house, he still need to handle you the pizza, take your cash and get back to the car.

That handling period is <i>tCL</i>.



<b>tRP [3]</b>

tCL-tRCD-<b>tRP</b>-tRAS

tRP [3] - <b>t</b>iming <b>R</b>ow <b>P</b>recharge

The time to exit the street.

Almost always you can just keep these two in sync:

<i>tRP [3] = tRCD [2]<i>



<b>tRAS [4]</b>

tCL-tRCD-tRP-<b>tRAS</b>

tRAS [4] - <b>t</b>iming <b>R</b>ow <b>A</b>ctive

How long the pizza guy has to stay on a street, <i>minimum</i>.


So you're the boss, you sold the pizza.

You tell the delivery guy to go look for this house on this street.

He goes, finds the street and as he drives towards the house you give him a call to immediately get back to the shop.

That's dumb, and that is when <i><b>tRAS</b> too low</i>.


So <b>tRAS</b> has to account for both <b>tCL</b> [1] and <b>tRCD</b> [2] and then some headroom.

That's why

<i>tRAS [4] = tCL [1] + tRCD [2] + 2</i>



<b>tRC [5]</b>

tCL-tRCD-tRP-tRAS-<b>tRC</b>

tRC [5] - <b>t</b>iming <b>R</b>ow <b>C</b>ycle

Yes, I added the 5th one to the list.

tRC [5] is <i>not</i> a primary timing, but in my opinion should be as it is directly related.

Not to be confused with <b>tRC<u>D</u></b> [2].


<i>tRC [5] = tRP [3] + tRAS [4]</i>

or, it follows,

<i>tRC [5] = tCL [1] + tRCD [2] + tRP [3]</i>

tRC [5] is the <i>full cycle</i> of all cycles combines.

tRC [5] accounts for the whole super-cycle - 

from "Ok, I'm leaving to deliver pizza" or "I'm ready to deliver another one"



<b>tRFC [refresh]</b>

tRFC - <b>t</b>iming <b>R</b>e<b>f</b>resh <b>C</b>ycle

tRFC [refresh] - is a very important a sub-timing.

<i>More important that than primaries.</i>

Imagine your RAM is a revolver that shoots bullets.

As some point the chamber needs reloading.


<i>tRFC [refresh] is the reloading time.</i>

You might notice it's a much larger number - usually around 600.

On a lucky lottery RAM stick you might push tRFC [refresh] down to 300.

That's twice the reloading time!


This is going to affect your FPS drops by a massive amount, 

You might see up to <b>20% FPS drop reduction</b>.

And that's on top of everything else.

Overclocking really stacks up.


But here's a problem.

tRFC [refresh] = reloading time = cooldown time.

<i>Cooling</i> down.

With shorter breaks your RAM is going to heat up more.

A hot RAM will crash.


Overclocking anything on a laptop is problematic because under load everything gets too hot.

CPU gets hot, GPU gets hot, the whole case is super hot and now you want to overclock RAM?

There's a limit how much is possible.



<b>tREFI</b>

tREFI [capacity] - <b>t</b>iming <b>Ref</b>resh <b>I</b>nterval

This is a DDR5 thing, I have not played with this one yet, but read about it.

Might as well mention here, it's pretty cool.


So if tRFC [refresh] is the reloading time,

tREFI [capacity] is <i>how often RAM needs to reload.</i>


Think of that revolver analogy and imagine increasing its chamber capacity from 6 to 12.

Now it can shoot more bullets before reloading.

So unlike other timings, you want to increase↑ tREFI [capacity].

To give it more juice. 

So RAM works with <i>less breaks</i>.


The problem is if you keep firing for a long time the barrel gets hot.

The overall logic is similar to tRFC [refresh], 

only it's <i>even more dangerous</i> to "overclock-and-forget",

because it is an electrial revolver and if the battery gets to 0%

the car runs out of gas and shuts down.



And this is going to be last in my list.

I hope I've managed to make this section easy to understand.

Now, what do you actually do with this information?

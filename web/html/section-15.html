<h2>CPU - Unlock FIVR</h2>

<p class="textstream">

Our next move is to unlock <b>FIVR</b> in ThrottleStop.

(If your FIVR buttons and sliders are <i>not</i> grayed out - you can skip this section.)



I want to preface this with mentioning that computers come in different configurations.

Models. Manufacturers. BIOS. Operating System.

You <i>might</i> have to do something different for your machine to unlock voltage controls.

And with some motherboards/CPUs it might not be possible at all.



But the below works for my MSI GF65.

1. Reboot your laptop and keep tapping Delete to enter <b>BIOS</b>.

2. Press Right Shift + Right CTRL + Left Alt + F2 to activate <b>Advanced Mode</b> (this works for MSI GF65, yours might vary)

3. Go to <b>Power and Performance</b>.

4. Go to <b>CPU Power Management Control</b>.

5. Go to <b>CPU Lock Configuration</b>.

6. Set <b>CFG Lock</b> and <b>Overclock Lock</b> to <i>Disabled</i>.

7. Press Right Shift + Right CTRL + Left Alt + F2 again to exit advanced mode, 

otherwise it might not let you save.

8. Save and Boot.



If you are on Windows 11 you <i>might</i> need to jump through extra hoops.


Try disabling "Core isolation" - "Memory integrity" in Windows Defender.

If still no, try disabling some of the "Windows Features":

- Try to disable "Windows Subsystem for Linux" (WSL2).
- Try to disable "Windows Sandbox".
- Try to disable "Hyper-V Hypervisor".
- Try to disable "Virtual Machine Platform".
- Try to delete the ThrottleStop config file (.ini)
- Try to reboot

If still no, try to look up on forums.

The answer exists.

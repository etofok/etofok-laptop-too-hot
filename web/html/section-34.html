<h2>Extra Tips - more ways to reduce heat</h2>

<p class="textstream">

You can buy a top tier thermal paste.

90% of the victory is the fact that you have it freshly applied, 

but you might squeeze a few degrees out of the best one.



See all these grills?

Let's praise MSI engineers - fantastic design in my opinion. 

Guess what - these are for airflow.



Where do you place your laptop when you use it?

I hope it's at least on a table.

And let it be know - it's pretty hard to get fresh air through a solid surface.

Elevate your laptop to allow it to breathe. 



In on similar note,

Just like a warm blanket keeps you warm and cozy,

It also does that with your laptop.

Bonus points - if you manage to block both the vents and the heat sinks.

Don't put it on a blanket.



I personally think cooling pads are useless.

It's a bulky pad, needs to be plugged, adds to noise, drastically reduces mobility and convenience. 

More over, it just doesn't work as your internal fans.

Like at all.

You need to blow air <i>through the heatsink</i>, which cooling pads just don't do.

Cooling pads blowing air <i>at the backplate of your laptop</i> is like an industrial fan blowing at a car.



You'd be better off buying a laptop stand. 

It's tiny, lightweight and actually useful.

I have one of these and it's great.

Got it for maybe $10.

You will definitely see a drop in temps due to improved ventilation alone.



After 5+ years of strain, it wouldn't be a bad idea to replace the cooling system.

Especially if your fans started to make noise.

It's a question of whether you can get your hands on a factory-new one easily (and how much you care).

It's not really expensive, but can make a big difference.

If you have a repair shop nearby - ask around.

On many laptops the replacement is super easy.

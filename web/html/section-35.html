<h2>Extra Tips - software</h2>

<p class="textstream">

When I work with other people computers the amount of garbage installed boggles my mind to an unfathomable degree every time.

I'm in no position to advise you on removing the Yahoo bar that's certainly an unremovable part of your workflow, 

but I can at least show you what I personally do.



<b>First</b>,

delete the apps that you don't use and don't install shady stuff on your main system.

I like revo-unistaller.

Allows me to uninstall even system level stuff.



<b>Second</b>, 

You need a debloat tool.

Debloat tools allow you to remove things from the system.

The list of things I don't want or need has become very long.

You can't remove everything - after all it's Windows - but you can strip it down to a manageable level.

Please note, these are highly intrusive, warranty voiding, license breaking tools.

But as far as I know they are legal.

Still, you probably shouldn't use these on machines that get audited and/or in commercial use.


I'm only familiar with winutil by CTT and debloat tool by raphire.

I've never had any issues with these tools. 

But you might want to create a safe point just in case.



You also want a <b>firewall</b>.

I really like simplewall.

It's simple and it's a wall.

I like it.



Another thing you might want to learn is how to use <b>package managers</b>. 

These are your Winget, Chocolatey and Scoop.

I personally use chocolatey for most things. 


Package managers allow you to easily manage all your software installs/uninstalls.

On top of it you can compile a simple .txt/.bat/.ps1 file with all the software you use,

and when you need to move systems you can install everything in one click.

It's just awesome, I wish someone told me about it years ago.



But this is already getting into system optimization, not hardware optimizations.

And maybe that's a story for another day.

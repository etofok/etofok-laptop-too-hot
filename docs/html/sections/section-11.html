<h2>CPU - Clock Ratio Multiplier</h2>

<p class="textstream">

CPU frequency is shown as one number (4.1 GHz, 2.4 GHz).

But it's actually two.



CPU frequency is <b>Core Speed</b> multiplied by a <b>Clock Ratio Multiplier</b>.

CPU core speed is universally 100Hz. 

It's fixed.



The "dynamic part" is the multiplier.

So,

100 MHz * 35 = 3.5 GHz

100 MHz * 38 = 3.8 GHz

100 MHz * 45 = 4.5 GHz

Very simple.



For example, 'Turbo Boost' adjusts the ratio multiplier from 24 to 41 (on GF65).

You might've heard that there are 'locked' CPUs and 'unlocked' CPUs. 

Specifically - 'locked'/'unlocked' clock multiplier.

This means there is a 'hard lock' to ratio multipliers to prevent people from tinkering with it.

So a CPU might come 'locked' at 41 multiplier.

You can't overclock the locked CPU.



But… great news that we can <b>under</b>clock even the locked ones. 

Which means we can adjust our Turbo… to be slightly less Turboey.

4.1 GHz Turbo may be too much, but 2.4 GHz may be too little.

But by adjusting the multiplier down

you can set it to anything you want: 4.0 GHz, 3.5 GHz, etc



This reduces the CPU performance output to your desired frequency.

But this also reduces stress and temperatures. 

Which might be a great compromise between non-Turbo and 'original' Turbo.

And you can easily tailor this to your specific situation, hardware and needs.

Even better - it takes 15 seconds to do.

Even even better - you can set a hotkey to swap between profiles.



Either way this is a great technique for your toolbelt. 

Especially for older, worn down laptops.

We already got an app for our GPU.

Now let's install our 'CPU app'.

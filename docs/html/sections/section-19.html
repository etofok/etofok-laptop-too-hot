<h2>GPU - memory</h2>

<p class="textstream">

Unlike CPU <b>core</b> and cache, 

GPU has <b>core</b> and <b>memory</b>.



GPU core does the math.

Raytracing, physics, delivering the image to your screen.



GPU memory holds data in its <b>VRAM</b>.

GPU can't manipulate your textures/files on your hard disk - so the GPU loads stuff into its VRAM.

So anything that requires unloading/loading stuff from/to VRAM - is a GPU memory task.



So far we played with <b>GPU core</b>.

But <b>GPU memory</b> can be adjusted directly in the main menu.

It's super easy - the slider is right there.

If you want more performance out of it - you might want to bump GPU memory.



The maximum you can push GPU memory is actually very high.

Depending on your card model (and your lottery luck) it can range from +200 MHz - +1000 MHz

And unlike GPU core - it doesn't really increase your temps much.

You can experiment with it.



Now on <b>Underclocking the memory</b>.

Underclocking GPU memory makes sense if you experience stability issues.

Like artifacts on your screen:

- Triangles flying. 

- Weird tearing. 

- Stripes out of nowhere.

- Random squares covering the screen.

The usual.



Underclocking GPU memory is a great way to save that GPU from going directly into the trash bin.

So if your GPU started acting out - try underclocking it first.

It almost always a solution.



I guess that covers the GPU.

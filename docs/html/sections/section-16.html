<h2>CPU - Undervolting the CPU</h2>

<p class="textstream">

Let's avoid the situation of booting up with voltages too low.

You don't want to end up in a reboot-loop:

when voltage is too low for the system to boot, so it reboots.

Endlessly.

So, don't set ThrottleStop to autolaunch yet.



Double check that ThrottleStop is active.

The label should say "Turn off".

I adjust [High Performance] profile first, because it has low EPP.

Due to low EPP it has constant maximum performance output, so you'll see the effect of your changes immediately.

 

Open FIVR.

General intelligence allows us to filter the world and pay attention to what's truly useful and discard everything else. 

In FIVR we're interested in these 3 yellow boxes:

<img class="" width="932" height="735" src="assets/images/v/ts-yellow-boxes.jpg" alt="">

First, 

notice there are <b>CPU core</b> and <b>CPU cache</b>.

These are different voltage "lanes".

You can undervolt both and benefit from undervolting both.



Second, 

go ahead and check <b>Unlock Adjustable Voltage</b>,

select <b>Adaptive</b>.

You are in.

This is the holy grail.

This is the game.



<b>With great power comes great responsibility.</b>

So don't do anything stupid.

Like <i>giving it</i> a massive amount of voltage.

Remember, all these voltage unlocks are so hidden and annoying, <b>because</b> these are "defense layers" that prevent users from fiddling with voltage.

You should not fiddle with voltage.



And just in case…

1 volt is 1000 millivolt.

Not sure how much that is in football fields.



1000mv is 1.000v

30mv is 0.03v. 

30mv is 0.030v.

30mv is 0.0300000000v.



Ok.

No reason to touch the first slider, leave it at Default.

Use the second slider to <b>Adaptively OFFSET</b> voltage value to the left (lower it).

<img class="" width="283" height="389" src="assets/images/v/ts-unlock-adaptive.jpg" alt="">

Start at -30mv, click ok. 

You should be ok.



Use TS Bench to stress the CPU. 

This will put your CPU under maximum possible load.

And if nothing happened… The CPU is OK with that setting. 

Works.

Nice.



You should already see a difference in temperature.



Go lower by 10mv for CPU Core and CPU Cache.

Stress it again.

Repeat the process until your laptop acts sketchy, reboots, or throws a Blue Screen Of Death (most likely).



Once this happens - congratulations.

You found the 'tipping point' where your system is no longer stable.

You want a stable system.

So let's nudge it back.



Please notice that we work with negative numbers…

...-50 -40 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50...



Boot back into Windows if you crashed and <b>revert</b> your undervolt by giving it the 10mv we took away.

So if you were testing -80mv and crashed - bump it (to the right) to -70mv.

If you crash again - just bump it again.

That's all there is to it: 

the goal is to find the lowest point at which it's stable.



Now. 

Unintuitively, CPU core and CPU cache <i>don't have to be in sync</i>.

Most likely, CPU cache throws in the tower before CPU core.

For example, 

my CPU cache gives up on me at -90mv voltage offset.

I get a BSOD.



However, 

if I set <b>CPU cache</b> just below the tipping point at <b>-85mv</b> to stabilize, 

I can drag <b>CPU core</b> all the way <b>down to -185mv</b> and still be stable. 

That's a lot.

Instead of -85mv and -85mv, I get -85mv and -185mv.

85+85 = 170

85+185 = 270

270/170 = 58,8% more.

Very nice.



Notice that you adjust <i>CPU core</i> and <i>CPU cache</i> <b>per ThrottleStop profile</b> (top-left).

Meaning, your Balanced profile can have different voltage offsets from your High Performance profile.

If you want. 

Personally, I've set my offsets to the same numbers between profiles and it works for me.



<b>Important</b>: 

ThrottleStop must be running to apply its effects.

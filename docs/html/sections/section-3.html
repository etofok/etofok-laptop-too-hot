<h2>Why don't they make them cooler?</h2>

<p class="textstream">

They can't.

You wanted the 4.1 GHz.

You wanted the 3060.

You got it.

They haven't promised it's going to be cool and quiet.



Manufacturers are concerned with delivering the advertised performance numbers. 

And <i>only then</i> how hot or loud your laptop gets.

Because customers can (and will) sue for not meeting the advertised performance numbers.

But they can't sue for it being too loud or too hot, because it's not mentioned in the advertisements. 



You bought it <b>because</b> you wanted performance.

You bought it to run heavy applications.

And heavy applications are very demanding in their nature.

And that requires a supporting force.

<b>Voltage</b>.

<h2>CPU - Why lower our performance?</h2>

<p class="textstream">

I wanted to give you a quick-and-dirty example how frequency and voltage directly affect temperature.

And that trick is a fantastic way to do it.

Because you can turn it on and off and see the effect immediately.



But really, why would you ever want to do that?

To lose ~30% performance?

Well, there are a couple of reasons.


<b>First</b>, 

sometimes you just don't need that Turbo 4.1 GHz speed.

2.4 GHz might be good enough for the task.



<b>Second</b>, 

it's not enjoyable to play on a heating pan.

Not only it's physically uncomfortable - hot and loud,

(especially if you're around other people)

it's also a constant reminder that the laptop is being fried.



<b>Third</b>, 

95°C degrees is the heat ceiling for most laptops.

When your laptop gets there you <i>lose</i> performance! 

The in-built safety mechanism tanks its own frequencies - hard - effectively underclocking itself on demand.

This mechanism is called <b>PROCHOT</b> 

(literally 'processor hot').



All CPUs have it.

That temp limit is usually 95°C.



And you better hope it does underclock your CPU at 95°C!

You don't want your components to heat up past the point of no return.

And 95°C is <i>very close</i>.

90°C degrees is already very hot, let alone <i>95°C</i>.

Let alone 95°C <i>that is sustained for a long time</i>.

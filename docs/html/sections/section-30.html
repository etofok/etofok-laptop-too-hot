<h2>Thermal paste - replacement tips</h2>

<p class="textstream">

A few words of caution.

Should help if you want to proceed with courage.



1. <b>Make sure the laptop is off before you begin.</b>

As in, <b><u>SHUTDOWN</u></b>. 

Not asleep. <b>SHUTDOWN</b>. 

<b>Super important!</b>

This needs to be explicitly stated, because most of us put it to sleep. 

And that's good - you should usually put it to sleep.

But for this job you need to <b>shut it down</b>.

<i>There should be zero electricity in the laptop</i>.



2. <b>It's possible to drop the laptop.</b>

You can elbow it. 

You can knee it.

It can slide off the table. 

It can slip from your hands.

You can drop it while flipping it around.

Just.. don't?

And while you can do the work on a soft mattress, I wouldn't recommend it. 

You might produce an ESD.



3. <b>Electrostatic discharge (ESD).</b>

Don't wear a wool sweater in your carpet ridden room as you wiggle your ass on a rubber mattress.

Put your laptop on a table.

Get rid of random items nearby, especially wool and fabrics.

Honestly, just clear up your working space, probably long overdue anyway.

Wear something sleeveless, or at least roll up.

Touch some metal to discharge hands.

If you're really scared of ESD you can invest in an ESD wristband and get an anti-static mat.

Will last you forever.



4. <b>It's possible to scratch the laptop.</b>

If you don't have a specialized tool - called the spudger - it is possible (very easy actually) to scratch the case while trying to open it.

As a backup option, use a butter-knife or a plastic card. 

Personal cards tend to be thinner (and are useless anyway).



5. <b>It's possible to sever important cables.</b>

This is mostly a macbook / iphone thing, but it's important to mention as a general precaution.

There are a couple of thin fragile cables that you don't want to cut accidentally.

Or purposefully.



6. <b>It's very possible to fuck up the screws.</b>

The moment you feel like unscrewing is not going as planned, 

find a thin rubber ribbon and place it in between the screw and your screwdriver.

I don't know how it works, but it does.

Also when you are screwing things back in - don't push it.

Not needed.



7. <b>It's possible to lose the screws.</b>

Dropping a screw inside the laptop is very annoying.

Dropping it under the motherboard - day ruining.

Get a screwdriver with a magnet tip.



8. <b>It's possible to drop or spill something onto the opened laptop.</b>

Genius tier.

Put drinks, hammers, animals, kids and girlfriends away from the work table.

And don't leave it unattended.

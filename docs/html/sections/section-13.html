<h2>CPU - ThrottleStop deeper dive</h2>

<p class="textstream">

This chapter is for the curious ones to explain why we don't check anything else by default.

There <b>are</b> cases where you actually want to set these.

Allow me to explain how all these settings work (and why).



<b>Speed Shift</b>. 

Speed Shift EPP stands for 'Energy Performance Preference'.

EPP 0 - maximum performance preference;

EPP 255 - maximum energy preference.


Put simply - what frequency your CPU 'prefers'.

High EPP - low clock speeds. Higher energy savings.

Low EPP - high clock speeds. Low energy savings.



Different Windows power plans have different EPP <i>already</i> built into them.

You can notice EPP values change in ThrottleStop as you switch between power profiles.

For example, [Better Battery] and [Better Performance] set EPP of my Intel i5-10200h to 84.

[Best Performance] sets EPP to 0.

This directly affects CPU behavior. 



On mid-to-high EPP CPU frequency fluctuates, 

depending on what CPU is doing.

If the CPU is doing nothing - it drops frequency,

but quickly ramps up when there is a task to do.



Low EPP makes your CPU work at its maximum frequency <i>all the time</i>, so that ramp up time is 0.

CPU is always ready.

High EPP is the opposite, so CPU is sluggish and lazy.

Like a sticky jello.

It's very noticeable actually.



What <i>practical</i> difference does this make?

Well, do you want to maintain the highest frequency or would you rather conserve some power?



Here's a good example, 

when you unplug your laptop it starts using the battery.

And if you run all your stuff at full power - it drain the battery faster.

At higher EPPs you draw the battery slower.

Slightly slower.

This gives you more battery charge - because you don't deplete it as fast.



The obvious use is to attach a higher EPP value to your 'I'm on the road' or 'Battery' profile, as it conserves the battery.

Another use is if you're using the laptop as a server and you run it 24/7 - you'll save on the electricity bill.

Not a tremendous amount, but still - it's a legitimate use case.



So, 

EPP 0 - max full performance always.

EPP 84-128 - mid point. Balanced.

EPP 200 - already noticeably slower.

EPP 255 - effectively soft-locks the clock speeds at their minimums around 800 MHz.



<b>SpeedStep</b>.

SpeedStep is an older version of EPP - we are talking Core 2 Duo tier.

The only difference is that unlike SpeedShift it's binary - all or nothing.

That's why it's a checkbox, not a slider.



<b>C1E</b>.

C1E is another power saving mechanism like EPP.

The difference is EPP affects 'active' CPU behavior, while C1E affects 'inactive' CPU behavior.

So they are related, but not exactly the same.

However you can follow the same logic.

Check C1E for your battery/server/idle profiles.

Uncheck it when you need your CPU to work.



<b>BD PROCHOT</b>.

As mentioned earlier PROCHOT - processor hot - is a safety mechanism that dynamically underclocks the CPU to prevent overheating.

<i>Very heavily underclocks it.</i>

<b>By gigahertz.</b>

Avoid hitting PROCHOT if you want to maintain performance.


But BD PROCHOT is not the same as PROCHOT.

PROCHOT is a CPU exclusive thing.

But your CPU may, in some very rare cases, receive 'Danger! Throttle now!' signals without actually hitting the PROCHOT <i>itself</i>.

That means some other component is sending the PROCHOT signal to the CPU.

Most likely a faulty one.


That means your CPU might operate at 0.8 GHz - the throttling speed - for seemingly no reason.

In this case you'd want to check BD PROCHOT in ThrottleStop.

I guess that's where its name is coming from.

The CPU will ignore all these signals <i>from other components</i>.

PROCHOT itself will still work just fine.

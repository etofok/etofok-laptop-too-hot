<h2>Thermal paste - intro</h2>

<p class="textstream">

Thermal paste (TP) - also known as thermal compound - dries up.

With use.

With time.

Entropy is a bitch.

No joke,

There might be <i>30°C degrees of difference</i>

between a freshly applied thermal paste and a dry one.

Depending on how barren it is.



No thermal paste = no heat transfer.

You want thermal paste, because you don't want <b>air between the chip and the cooling system</b>.

Thermal paste ensures there's no air, so heat gets transferred.



Kind of like you can sit in a 90°C sauna but can't in 90°C water - 

because water is a better conductor than air.

And thermal paste is an even better conductor.



Do no ignore this.

It doesn't get better.

With enough time you'll be idling at 50°C+ degrees, and running heavy apps is going to be impossible.

Your fans will run at 100% but you'll be at PROCHOT temps all the time.

This kills the laptop.



The good thing I found my MSI laptop to be very easy to work with.

With proper tools and some experience it's possible to disassemble, replace thermal paste and put everything back in under 15 minutes.

Your first time is always going to be awkward.

As is with many things in life.

But this is seriously not complicated, especially if you have access to YouTube.

I promise, people have disassembled your exact laptop on camera.



I'm going to show you how I do it, step by step. 

But before that - a few words of caution on how you can damage and break things.

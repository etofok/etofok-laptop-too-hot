<h2>GPU - over/underclocking</h2>

<p class="textstream">

You can also over<b>clock</b> and under<b>clock</b> the GPU in that CTRL+F Curve menu.

If you want.

Just drag the node to a lower / higher frequency at a desired voltage.

But always stress test and pay attention to your benchmark score and temps.

It's always a balance between stability, temperature and performance.

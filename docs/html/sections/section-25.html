<h2>RAM - overclocking, the process</h2>

<p class="textstream">

The first thing you want to max out is frequency / trasfer speed / bandwidth.

Bump the multiplier by one.

Keep the 2-to-1 MT/s-to-MHz ratio.

DDR [2] : [1] MCLK = UCLK = FCLK.



For example, going

from DDR 2666 MT/s : 1333 MHz MCLK/UCLK/FCLK

to DDR 2933 MT/s : 1466 MHz MCLK/UCLK/FCLK

is a good starting point that gives a real benefit.

Next try bumping the multiplier again by 1.

DDR 3200 MT/s : 1600 MHz MCLK/UCLK/FCLK

If you boot, congratulations, that is insane.

Now do a lot of tests.



But most likely you won't succeed and won't boot.

Because that is an massive overclock. 

Remember, we haven't touched voltage or timings, but just sped up everything by 12/10 20%.



So what you can try is giving RAM a little (a little) more DRAM voltage.

We are talking maybe 0.10v.

Very little.

Voltage is damaging and reduces lifespan of your components, including RAM, so I would base my decision making how much voltage to give purely based on how rich I am.

(That's why I undervolt my things.)

Usually, laptop DDR4 RAM sits at 1.2v (as per industry standard), and if you have XMP profile you'll see a bump to 1.35v

That's 0.15v of difference.

So that range is probably safe.



Any more is already pushing it.

1.4v (+0.2v off the non-XMP baseline) is probably the frying pan territory for the laptop.

Remember,

heat from voltage scales quadratically, so going from 1.2v to 1.4v is <i>36% more</i> heat.

And because we are trying to add 20% to our MT/s (10 → 12), that is another 20% heat just from frequency alone, 

so, (don't quote me there, but this is how I understand it)

1.36 * 1.2 = 63% hotter of the baseline?

Yikes.

Desktop RAM can handle that, probably, but laptop?

I wouldn't be so sure.

Consider, again, that under stress your <i>entire laptop</i> heats up like a pan - CPU works, GPU works...

and all this heat stacks on each other.

Think of the poor crammed laptop RAM with no heat sinks.



So give it +0.1v or +0.15v and try to boot again that that multiplier.

If it doesn't boot that's still in the realm of normal.

We need to worsen the timings to the 'previous' level.



Remember, increasing MCLK/DDR speeds up all your cycles.

Which might result in not enough time to complete the job:

too few cycles at a much faster speed = not enough real time.

So it is reasonable at this point to actually <i>increase</i> timings up.



If you had something like 

18-20-20-44 at 10 multiplier, then to maintain the same allocated real-time you need to bump timings by a relative amount i.e.

+10%
20-22-22-48

(because going from 10 → 11 multiplier is 11/10 = 10% more)
(because going from 11 → 12 multiplier is 12/11 = another 9% more)

These timings are nearly identical in real-time performance between 10→11 (2666 MT/s → 2993 MT/s).



<b>but</b> 

1) we added more bandwidth (MT/s) with all its benefits

2) all the other sub-timings - such as tRFC [refresh] - still complete their cycles faster

Realistically, this <i>should</i> allow you to boot.

And at this point I would do my first hard tests.


If you can't boot even with loosened timings, most likely, you just can't jump to this level of bandwidth MT/s.

Settle at the previous ratio (11 in my case), and switch your attention to getting better timings.



I personally hold an opinion 

(that I'm not married to) 

that if you have achieved two step ups i.e. 10→12 or 11→13

even with +0.1v and 10%/20% looser primary timings,

this is fantastic.



Best timing to actually tighten is tRFC [refresh].

tRFC [refresh] needs excessive testing, and from this point onward I would test for longer periods every step up.



You can also look up online other peoples' results. 

This usually gives a decent benchmark, which is going to safe you a lot of time.

No need to test tRFC 400 at 3200 MT/s if you already know it's not going to work anyway.

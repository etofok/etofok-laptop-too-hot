<h2>Fans - controlling airflow</h2>

<p class="textstream">

To control the fans on MSI laptop - install SilentOption - it's very lightweight and simple.

Proprietary MSI Dragon Center is a super heavy app, for no reason.

Another common option is FanControl by Rem0o. 

Works on my desktop.

On Linux CoolerControl is amazing, massively better than any other option.



Fan speed is a delicate balance between actual cooling and being too loud and obnoxious.



I follow this logic.

My surfing activities do not require a lot of cooling.

And if I'm working I'd rather have it quiet.

I guess Apple realized that as well,

and made their laptops super quiet by removing fans entirely.



So under no load I keep my fans at their absolute minimums.

30°C degrees to 40°C degrees doesn't matter to me as much as 0% fans and 35% fans.



Then I figure out where is my 'under load' point.

Usually it's around 40-50°C degrees.

At which point I enable the fans.

I then set the curve to straight line increase to 100% at 80°C.

So,

40°C 0% -> 80°C 100%



Under load I go very aggressive, because we need all the cooling we can get.

And I want to keep my components below 80°C degrees,

so when they reach 80°C, there is no reason to not have my fans at less than 100%.

It's better to strain your cooling system than to strain your components. 



It'll take a long time for them to break - they are not fragile at all.

Replacing the cooling system is cheap, maybe $50-100 tops. 

To replace the CPU/GPU is to replace the whole motherboard as these are soldered onto it. 

Which is almost as expensive as buying a new laptop, minus the case, screen, RAM, and drives.



When I'm playing I always play with headphones on, 

and with noise cancelling 

and being naturally immersed into gameplay I don't really notice the fans.

But I notice the temps.

So that's works for me.

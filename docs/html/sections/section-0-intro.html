<h2>About</h2>

<p class="textstream">

This is a mini-book, about 70 000 characters long.

It's pretty extensive.



It's about how I cooled my gaming laptop from CPU 95° GPU 86° degrees to CPU 77° GPU 71° without losing performance while playing Cyberpunk 2077 on Ultras.

With every technique explained in detail.

(MSI GF65 i5-10200H, 3060, DDR4-2666, Windows)



As you can see from the table of contents - it's a full-blown tech manual.

There are a lot of skills to pick up along the way.

And almost everything in here is applicable to almost every computer - be it a laptop or desktop.

They come in different configurations, and I can't possibly account for every single one.

I tried my best to balance between general knowledge and specific actionable steps.

I'll walk you through what I did and provide context around it.



I wrote it because I wanted to document it.

But sometimes things need context.

And sometimes that context requires even more context.

So at some point I started including all the relevant info that I gathered over 20 years on these topics.

And at this point - it's a guided course, a walkthrough, a series of tutorials - just with a specific laptop in mind that 'makes it real'.

So, I like it.



I'll tell you a secret.

Most of it was written back in August of 2022.

And then - forgotten.

It never saw any light.

(maybe Google included this in its AI training since it was a Google Doc)



But in early 2026 I had a chance to revisit it.

So I did.

The entire text is written and formatted by me, by hand.



Please enjoy.

I'm sure you will get a lot out of it.
